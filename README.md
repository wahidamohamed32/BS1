## Getting Started (for Developers)

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Troubleshooting

#### PowerShell "script cannot be loaded" Error
If you encounter an error like `npm : File ... npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled`, it is due to PowerShell's execution policy.

**Solution 1 (Recommended):**
Run the command in **Command Prompt (cmd)** instead of PowerShell.

**Solution 2 (PowerShell):**
Temporarily bypass the execution policy for the current session:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```
Then try running `npm run dev` again.

**Solution 3 (Permanent):**
Change the execution policy for your user (allows local scripts):
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

#### Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS Error
If you see an error about `tailwindcss` moving to a separate package for PostCSS:
1. Install the PostCSS plugin:
   ```bash
   npm install @tailwindcss/postcss
   ```
2. Update `postcss.config.js`:
   ```js
   export default {
     plugins: {
       '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
       autoprefixer: {},
     },
   }
   ```
3. Update `src/index.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss";`.
